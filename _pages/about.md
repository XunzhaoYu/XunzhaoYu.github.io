Ph.D. in Computer Science. 

I have been working as a Research Fellow at the Department of Economics, University of Warwick since January 2024.
Focusing on the UKPlanning project led by 
<a href='https://sites.google.com/site/kulkaamrita/home'>Dr. Kulka, Amrita</a> (assistant professor) and 
<a href='https://nikhil-datta.com/'>Dr. Datta, Nikhil</a> (assistant professor).

My research interests are **Machine Learning** and **Optimization**, including:   
Deep Learning, Meta-Learning, Transfer Learning, 
Bayesian Optimization, Reinforcement Learning, Evolutionary Computation, 
Statistical Learning, Time Series Analysis, Stochastic Processes. 

`B.Sc.` I obtained a B.Sc. at the Department of Computer Science & Technology, <a href='https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/'>Nanjing University</a>.  
During my undergraduate study, I joined the <a href='https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/MainPage.ashx'>Learning And Mining from DatA (LAMDA)</a> group. 
Supervised by <a href='https://www.wolai.com/eyounx/dtR1MTyRXS5tP5Cex4KtdK'>Prof. Yang Yu</a>, I began systematic study and research on Machine Learning, Statistical Learning, and Bayesian Optimization. It was an honor to be supervised by Prof. Yu.  

`Ph.D.` After my undergraduate study, I completed my Ph.D. at the School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham.  
Both of my supervisors left the University of Birmingham during my first Ph.D. year. I completed my Ph.D. independently, developing a **strong ability to conduct independent research**.  
My Ph.D. study was funded by Ford Motor Company (USA), 
which gave me the opportunity to collaborate with several applied engineers and technical experts from Ford USA 
(<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PCA9jesAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr. Yan Wang</a>, 
<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dhZRSRIAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr. Dimitar Filev</a>) 
and gain experience in solving complex real-world problems.

During my spare time, I collaborate with professors from top universities to conduct research on the mathematical theory underlying machine learning and optimization.  
In addition, I am interested in finance and am actively learning about quantitative research.
